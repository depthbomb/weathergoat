1. Create a `.env` file in the _project root_ directory and fill it out:
```env
MODE=development

BOT_ID=1234
BOT_TOKEN=token_here

# optional
SENTRY_DSN=https://1234.ingest.us.sentry.io/5678

GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=abcdef

MAX_ALERT_DESTINATIONS_PER_GUILD=5
MAX_FORECAST_DESTINATIONS_PER_GUILD=5
```
2. Run migrations with `bun migrate:p`
   - This won't do anything if there are no pending migrations
3. Register application commands globally with `bun start mc create` or in specific guilds with `bun start mc create <guild_id_1> <guild_id_2> <etc...>`
4. Run the bot with `bun start`
